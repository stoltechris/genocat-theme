abstract: "Genetics data visualization plays an important role in the sharing of knowledge from cancer genome research. Many types of visualization are widely used, most of which are static and require sufficient coding experience to create. Here, we present Oviz-Bio, a web-based platform that provides interactive and real-time visualizations of cancer genomics data. Researchers can interactively explore visual outputs and export high-quality diagrams. Oviz-Bio supports a diverse range of visualizations on common cancer mutation types, including annotation and signatures of small scale mutations, haplotype view and focal clusters of copy number variations, split-reads alignment and heatmap view of structural variations, transcript junction of fusion genes and genomic hotspot of oncovirus integrations. Furthermore, Oviz-Bio allows landscape view to investigate multi-layered data in samples cohort. All Oviz-Bio visual applications are freely available at https://bio.oviz.org/."
