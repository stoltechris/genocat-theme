abstract: "Identifying disease-causing variants from exome sequencing projects remains a challenging task that often requires bioinformatics expertise. Here we describe a user-friendly graphical application that allows medical professionals and bench biologists to prioritize and visualize genetic variants from human exome sequencing data. We have implemented VCF/Plotein, a graphical, fully interactive web application able to display exome sequencing data in VCF format. Gene and variant information is extracted from Ensembl. Cross-referencing with external databases and application-based gene and variant filtering have also been implemented. All data processing is done locally by the user’s CPU to ensure the security of patient data."
