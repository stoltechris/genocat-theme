abstract: "Gepard provides a user-friendly, interactive application for the quick creation of dotplots. It utilizes suffix arrays to reduce the time complexity of dotplot calculation to Theta(m*log n). A client-server mode, which is a novel feature for dotplot creation software, allows the user to calculate dotplots and color them by functional annotation without any prior downloading of sequence or annotation data. AVAILABILITY: Both source codes and executable binaries are available at http://mips.gsf.de/services/analysis/gepard"
