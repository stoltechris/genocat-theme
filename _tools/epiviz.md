abstract: "Visualization is an integral aspect of genomics data analysis where the output of procedures performed in computing environments like Bioconductor is often visualized. Algorithmic-statistical analysis and interactive visualization are usually disjoint but are most effective when used iteratively. We introduce tools that provide this tight-knit integration: Epiviz (http://epiviz.cbcb.umd.edu), a web-based genome browser, and the Epivizr Bioconductor package allowing interactive, extensible and reproducible visualization within a state-of-the-art data analysis platform."
