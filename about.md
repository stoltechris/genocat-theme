# Hundreds of ways to visualize genomic data.

This site provides a database of genomic visualization tools. Each tool has been sorted and grouped based on various attributes, and this website has been designed to help you find what youâ€™re looking for. Our review article on genomic visualization tools (*Tasks, Techniques, and Tools for Genomic Data Visualization*) can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02853.pdf).

## Contributing

GenoCAT is a crowdsourced resource. Data visualization tool developers can [add their own tools](/submission/) to GenoCAT or edit any errors users may come across when browsing through tool pages.
